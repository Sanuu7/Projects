    <h1>Audio Vibe - Your Next Everyday App</h1>
    <p>Audio Vibe uses YouTube Music API to deliver audio vibes to everyone's heart and soul. With an exquisite UI that is easy to use and multi-language support, Audio Vibe is made with open-source files, so you don't have to worry about your privacy. We remove every tracker to its grave as long as you continue to use our service.</p>
    <h2>No More Ads</h2>
    <p>No more ads and begging every next song like one of those upside-down good day biscuits. Get the most out of our app with Quick Pics, Top Musics, Easy Evenings, Late Night Chill, Google Powered Recommendations, and much more.</p>
    <h2>Explore</h2>
    <p>Besides that, the picks are in your hands when you explore the New Release Section, New Charts, Moods and Genres, New Albums and Singles, and Trending.</p>
    <h2>Track Your Songs</h2>
    <p>What? You forgot what you just listened to? No worries, Audio Vibe is here to help. You can track all of the songs you listened to and the artists you listened to and the albums you've played.</p>
    <h2>Plan Your Trip</h2>
    <p>Planning to go on a trip? Don't worry, we got you. Create playlists and add your songs to favorites to keep your favorite songs all in one place.</p>
    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <p>Talking about the appearance, we use a total of 19 color themes plus we use the new Dynamic Theme Engine with Material You Colors which adapts colors according to your wallpapers. Dark Mode is always there to make your eyes stress-free!</p>
    <h2>Customizations</h2>
    <p>Customizations are one par ahead if you ask me. Set default tabs on opening as Home, Recent Songs, Recent Artists, Recent Albums, or Playlist/Favorites. Customize what to show! You can hide these tabs as you wish to anytime you want. Set lyrics position as you want where your eyes are comfortable.</p>
    <h2>Language Support</h2>
    <p>We support 80+ languages thanks to Google.</p>
    <h2>Bypass Content Restrictions</h2>
    <p>YouTube blocks some of the songs from different countries. You can bypass the content by choosing what country's content you want to watch (no VPNs were harmed).</p>
    <h2>Quality Control</h2>
    <p>You can choose quality from Low to High.</p>
    <h2>Persistent Queue</h2>
    <p>Persistent Queue for more precise recommended songs after a song is done.</p>
    <h2>Skip Silence</h2>
    <p>Skip silence if there is any (thanks to Vanced Patches).</p>
    <h2>Audio Normalization</h2>
    <p>Audio normalization to balance the songs to have integrated loudness.</p>
    <h2>Auto Download</h2>
    <p>Auto download your songs that are added to playlists.</p>
    <h2>More Actions on Music Panel</h2>
    <p>More actions on music panel on notification center.</p>
    <h2>Your Privacy Matters</h2>
    <p>We are concerned about your privacy so we don't support any cloud sync or any accounts. So there are options to backup and recover your songs and playlist as Database (Songs and playlists), Preferences (Settings), and migrate to a different device.</p>
